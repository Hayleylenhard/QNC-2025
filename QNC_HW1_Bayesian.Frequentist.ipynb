    "A positive test at the p<0.05 level is not necessarily \"statistically significant.\" The p value is just the probability of obtaining those particular results if the null hypothesis (no difference/effect) is true. In this example, this is the same as the false positive rate of 5%. So the positive test at the p<0.05 level could just mean that that person tested positive even though they do not actually have HIV. Also, since there is only one person in this example, it's hard to draw any meaning from a single test result. "
